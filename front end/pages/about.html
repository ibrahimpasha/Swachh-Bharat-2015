<h1>About Swachh Bharat</h1>
<h4>Swachh Bharat is a link between government, 
planners, implementers and people. Swachh Bharat 
shall help government know what and where amenities 
are required, citizens can contribute towards smarter
cities with their suggestions and work and planner and
implementors can access actionable data.</h4>
<h4>Swachh Bharat is an android and a web application. 
The users need to click a photo with the application of
the garbage that found at their colonies or along roadsides
or where so ever that can be cleaned and post it in the Swachh Bharat 
database. The location of the garbage is automatically captured and shown 
to the people who are residing near the garbage through the application 
and the website. People coordinate among themselves to clean the area
by creating an event on a particular day.</h4>
