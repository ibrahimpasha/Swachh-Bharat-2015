# Swachh-Bharat-2015

Swachh Bharat is a link between government, planners, implementers and people.
Swachh Bharat shall help government know what and where amenities are required,
citizens can contribute towards smarter cities with their suggestions and work and planner
and implementors can access actionable data. These days as the use of internet has grown
and people get easily notified about all the information around the world. Swachh Bharat
helps in notifying people around a particular area so that campaigns can be formed to
serve the purpose. It also enlightens other people to actively participate in the events as
people post about their events and how successful were they conducted which provides
new people in conducting events in different areas. This ultimately serves the purpose
which leads to clean India.
